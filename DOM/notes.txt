    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <p>DOM:- document object model</p>
    <p>in it the manupulation of the DOM has to be learned. in it the working of the whole webpage has to be learned in it.<br>
    In it the things happening on the webpage is studied and after this the events (buttons, processes) everything is understanded by the systems.
    you have to know about the drawing of DOM in paper or any kind of platform for its better understanding.<br>
    in it you have to have a basic understanding of how things are working in a proper manner.
    example of a proper DOM is as follows
    <window->
        <Document->
            <HTML->
                <head></head>//further attributes and text nodes
                <body></body>//further attributes and text nodes
                //you can get many information by it for example 
                console.log(Document.baseURI);//gives you the url of the website you are watching.
                HTML collection, node collections, arrays they are different but they can be converted in array for performing the basics/advance operations.
                you can ge the tags by their ID with the help of the attribute:- getElemtnById and it is used as 
                document.getElementById('<id-name>');
                    and you can change the values by    using the same things with a different attributes named as:-
                    document.getElemntById('<id-name').<operation'sname>= <task to perform>

                        this is the basics inte=roduction of the DOM and it is just the starting of it to perform the good operations.
