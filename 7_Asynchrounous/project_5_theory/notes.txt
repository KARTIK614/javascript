to learn about the async JS you have to get a Command on some functions which is the main objective of this project.
those function are given by the browser to you.

=> setTimeout(Handler, 2000):-
it runs the code present in the function after the given time in milliseconds.

-> Handler:- it is just a call back function
-> time is given in milliseconds in that function.
-> you can give the referance of the function in the setTimeout function as well.
-> you can stop the setTimeout function before its execution by the use of clearTimeout function.
=>to see it in a practical way see the code.



=> setInterval:- this is just as same as the setTimeout function.
