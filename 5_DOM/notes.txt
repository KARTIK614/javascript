    <h1 class="heading">DOM manupulation on chai or code</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <p>DOM:- document object model</p>
    <p>in it the manupulation of the DOM has to be learned. in it the working of the whole webpage has to be learned in it.<br>
    In it the things happening on the webpage is studied and after this the events (buttons, processes) everything is understanded by the systems.
    you have to know about the drawing of DOM in paper or any kind of platform for its better understanding.<br>
    in it you have to have a basic understanding of how things are working in a proper manner.
    example of a proper DOM is as follows
    <window->
        <Document->
            <HTML->
                <head></head>//further attributes and text nodes
                <body></body>//further attributes and text nodes
                //you can get many information by it for example 
                console.log(Document.baseURI);//gives you the url of the website you are watching.
                HTML collection, node collections, arrays they are different but they can be converted in array for performing the basics/advance operations.
                you can ge the tags by their ID with the help of the attribute:- getElemtnById and it is used as 
                document.getElementById('<id-name>');
                    and you can change the values by    using the same things with a different attributes named as:-
                    document.getElemntById('<id-name').<operation'sname>= <task to perform>

                        this is the basics inte=roduction of the DOM and it is just the starting of it to perform the good operations.
                        
            </HTML->
        </Document->
    </window-> -->

        DOM Manupulation predefiend functions:-<span style = "display: none;">text text</span>
        </h1>
        <p>
            # topics in the format of learning:-<br><br>
            1. getElementById -> used to get the defined element by a defined ID and perfroming needed operations on it.<br>
            example:- document.getElementById(heading)<br>
            2. getAttribute():- gets the attribute of the element by its ID to manupulate.<br>
            example:- document.getElementById('heading').getAttribute('class')<br>
            3. setAttribute():- it is used to set the attributes in the file, it always overwrited the attributes.<br>
            example:-document.getElementById(heading).setAttribute('class','test')-> this will overwrite the classname with test.<br>
            4. styling via JS<br>
            example:- title.style.backgroundColor = 'green';<br>
            5. you can apply almost each and every value using the JS which is required in frontend.<br><br><br>
            -> getting the data from the webpage:-<br><br>
            1. textContent:- get the content of the tag, it shows all the text present in the bar.<br>
            example:-title.textContent<br>
            2.innerText:-it only shows the text has to displayed on the screen, not the hidden one(for example:- you can hide the text in span tag giving its display: none;)<br>
            example:-title.innerText<br>
            3.innerHTML:-  in it if some kind of HTML is written down in it then you can get the whole value as well.<br>
            example:-title.innerHTML<br><br>
            # REAL WORLD QUERY SELECTORS:- <br><br>
            1. document.querySelector('h1'):- you will get theh frost h1 from the queries in it.<br> 
            examples:- document.querySelector('h1') -> gives you the first heading<br>
            document.querySelector(#title) -> gives you the ID of the required syntax:-<br>
            document.querySelector(.heading) ->gives you the class of the required syntax:-<br>
            there are many query selectors are present in the market for the requred purposes you can learn them on the go, but some of them are as follows:-<br>
            go through with querySelectorAll to get the most of the things in JS.<br>
            in it we get node list which is slightly different from the array.<br>
            try to use the node list because it provied a froEac loop to ooperate on it.<br>
            use Array,from(variableName_of_assigned_nondeList).<br>
